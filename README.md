** Model Library **

*This is an example of a model library*

The idea is to have a library that will have shelves,
the shelves will have books, and the books will have a
category of fiction or non-fiction. There will also be
a random function, that when called will grab a random
book from a random shelf, so that it can be either 
fiction or non-fiction. If additional shelves or books
are added, this function will still work, as long as 
the shelves are properties of the library.
